# Technical Decisions

## Dependency Versions

| Dependency | Version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Kotlin | 2.0.21 | Stable, Compose compiler compatible |
| AGP | 8.8.0 | Stable, compatible with JDK 21 |
| Compose BOM | 2024.12.01 | Latest stable Compose |
| Room | 2.6.1 | Stable with KSP support |
| WorkManager | 2.10.0 | Latest stable |
| Navigation Compose | 2.8.5 | Latest stable |
| DataStore | 1.1.1 | Latest stable |
| KSP | 2.0.21-1.0.28 | Kotlin compatible |
| Coroutines | 1.9.0 | Latest stable |

## Architecture Decisions

### Single Module
Chosen for F-Droid simplicity and easier maintenance. The app uses a clear package structure within a single module.

### Room Database
Chosen over DataStore for complex relational data (sessions, food entries, etc.). DataStore used only for simple preferences.

### Foreground Service for Timer
Ensures timer survives background and process death. Database timestamps used as source of truth.

### No ML Dependencies
ML features deferred to keep the app F-Droid friendly and avoid large binary dependencies. Heuristic features provide similar functionality.

## Algorithm Decisions

### Growth Score
Weighted component system (0-100) with configurable weights. Transparent calculation with visible components.

### Loop Detection
Cosine similarity between daily routine vectors. Threshold-based with growth/novelty context to reduce false positives.

### Nutrition Quality
Weighted scoring of protein, fiber, added sugar, sodium, and micronutrients. Simple but transparent.

### Sleep Debt
Accumulated deficit over 7 days. Simple and understandable.

## Privacy Decisions

### No Cloud by Default
All data local. Optional features (barcode, online lookup) disabled by default with explicit consent.

### Medical Language
All health indicators use educational, non-diagnostic language. Persistent symptoms always point to healthcare professionals.

### Sensitive Data Opt-In
Weight, calories, body metrics hidden by default. User controls visibility.
